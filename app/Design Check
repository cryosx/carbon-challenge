I will be making questionable design choices and recording them here

[1] Blurred Background for SignIn/SignUp Form

Location:

    ~/client/templates/overrideTemplates/useraccounts/fullPageAtForm

Details:

    Added a class called <signIn-signUp> to allow for blurred backgrounds on the signIn/signUp form card.
    The code/css can be found at http://codepen.io/akademy/pen/FlkzB.

    CSS
        .YOUR_CLASS:before {
          content: "";
          position: fixed;
          left: 0;
          right: 0;
          z-index: -1;

          display: block;
          background-image: url('http://666a658c624a3c03a6b2-25cda059d975d2f318c03e90bcf17c40.r92.cf1.rackcdn.com/unsplash_527bf56961712_1.JPG');
          width: 1200px;
          height: 800px;

          -webkit-filter: blur(5px);
          -moz-filter: blur(5px);
          -o-filter: blur(5px);
          -ms-filter: blur(5px);
          filter: blur(5px);
        }

[2] Excessive Use of <black-text> to Convert White Icons and Text to Black

Location:

    ~/client/templates/shared/header

Resolution:

    I should consider changeing the default color to white so that I don't have to keep using <black-text>
